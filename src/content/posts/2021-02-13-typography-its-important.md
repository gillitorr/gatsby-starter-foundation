## What's so important about typography? What even is it?

Typography is the style, arrangement, or appearance of printed letters on a page, and it is all about usability. By optimizing typography, you are also optimizing readability, accessibility, and usability. Can your audience read the particular typeface you've chosen? Are you using too many fonts? Is the font your using also readable on mobile devices? These are important questions to ask because websites are all about conveying information. This excerpt states, "95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: Typography."

Before we jump into more about typography, let's review Typeface vs. Font.

## Typeface vs. Font

A typeface is the design of a collection of glyphs (e.g. letters, numbers, symbols) while a font is a specific size, weight, or style of a typeface (e.g. regular, bold, italic). These words are still used interchangeably and there are actually some inside jokes for web developers on Twitter surrounding using the words "typeface" versus  "font".  

## Example of 2 Typefaces Conveying Different Emotions

Let's take a look at the two typefaces Bodoni 72 and Tsukushi A Round Gothic, as pictured below.

These two typefaces convey a different type of emotion despite being the same sentence. Personally, I think the Bodoni 72 font looks more professional. I could see it being used on websites for traveling or for businesses who are trying to sell something related to virtual reality. "Gaming. A new kind of experience." 

The Tsukushi A Round Gothic typeface, on the other hand, looks like it would be used for a preschool or an elementary school's website, or maybe even a tutoring website for children in those grades. "Learning. A new kind of experience."

Depending on what your website is trying to convey to its audience, you may want to check the font you are using to make sure it's what you want to show users. On top of that, or most importantly, you want to make sure the font is still readable in any of its styles (italic, bold).
