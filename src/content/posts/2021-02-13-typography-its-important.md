## What's so important about typography? What even is it?

Typography is the style, arrangement, or appearance of printed letters on a page, and it is all about usability. By optimizing typography, you are also optimizing readability, accessibility, and usability. Can your audience read the particular typeface you've chosen? Are you using too many fonts? Is the font your using also readable on mobile devices? These are important questions to ask because websites are all about conveying information. This excerpt states, "95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: Typography."

Before we jump into more about typography, let's review Typeface vs. Font.

## Typeface vs. Font

A typeface is the design of a collection of glyphs (e.g. letters, numbers, symbols) while a font is a specific size, weight, or style of a typeface (e.g. regular, bold, italic). These words are still used interchangeably and there are actually some inside jokes for web developers on Twitter surrounding using the words "typeface" versus  "font".  

## Example of 2 Typefaces Conveying Different Emotions

Let's take a look at the two typefaces Bodoni 72 and Tsukushi A Round Gothic, as pictured below. 

![Image showing two different fonts: Bodoni 72 and Tsukushi A Round Gothic](/assets/fontblog.png "Font (or Typeface) Difference")

These two typefaces convey a different type of emotion despite being the same sentence. Personally, I think the Bodoni 72 font looks more professional. I could see it being used on websites for traveling or for businesses who are trying to sell something related to virtual reality. "Gaming. A new kind of experience." 

The Tsukushi A Round Gothic typeface, on the other hand, looks like it would be used for a preschool or an elementary school's website, or maybe even a tutoring website for children in those grades. "Learning. A new kind of experience."

Depending on what your website is trying to convey to its audience, you may want to check the font you are using to make sure it's what you want to show users. On top of that (or most importantly), you want to make sure the font is still readable in any of its styles (italic, bold). If you want to learn some tips on how to optimize typography, take a look at the ten tips listed below!

## Tips on Typography

The 10 tips below are a summary of the information I gathered from Nick Babich's "10 Tips On Typography in Web Design". The link to the full article can be found at the bottom of this page. 

1. Only use one to two typefaces - You should only use around one to two since any more than that can make the website look unstructured and unprofessional. If you choose to use two typefaces, you also want to make sure that the two typefaces complement each other based on their character width.
2. Try to use standard fonts - While it may be tempting to use the endless number of interesting fonts given by font embedding services such as Google Web Fonts or Typekit, you should still choose wisely. You want to avoid using fonts that distract users from reading (that's what your website is for!) 
3. Limit the line length -  Try to have the right amount of characters on each line for easier readability. For mobile devices, you should go for 30-40 characters per line.
4. Choose a Typeface that works well in various sizes - Since users will access your website from various screen sizes and resolutions, it is important to use a Typeface that works well for each one.  
5. Use fonts with distinguishable letters - For some typefaces, it is hard to distinguish between letters such as "i"s and "L"s. Make sure this isn't the case for the typeface you choose for your website!
6. Don't use all caps - While all caps text is fine for acronyms or logos, don't use it for anything users will need to read for a while. After all, ALL CAPS IS HARD TO READ FOR TOO LONG JUST LIKE THIS SENTENCE.
7. Don't minimize spacing between lines - Leading, or line height, is vertical white space between lines of text. By increasing line height, you also improve the readability. Leading should be about 30% more than the character height for good readability. 
8. Make sure you have sufficient color contrast - The more visible the text is, the faster users are able to read it. Avoid using the same or similar colors for text and background. "The W3C recommends the following contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background. Large text (at 14 pt. bold/ 18 pt. regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background. Once you've made a color choice, it's absolutely necessary to test it out with real users on most devices" (Babich).
9. Avoid red or green text - Red and green color blindness is the most common form of color blindness; so try not to use them!
10. Avoid flashing text - Text that flashes can be annoying or distracting for users. In some cases, they may even trigger seizures for some individuals. 

Now that we know some ways to optimize typography, let's see what's trending on modern websites.
