One issue I have with websites on mobile devices is that some aren't responsive. For example, I remember back in high school my high school's website was a pain to navigate through because the website only targeted visitors who were on a desktop rather than any device smaller than that. I couldn't see the navigation bar clearly and when I tried to search for something, the search bar would be so small it would be difficult to tap. This frustration may be what users on your website may feel if you don't make it responsive!



## What is Responsive Web Design?

Mobile has changed the way everyone interacts with and designs websites. In order to adapt to these smaller screen sizes, the web industry/web designers needed a solution to allowing design across various devices. This solution is responsive web design, in which the website's design responds to the user's behavior based on screen size, platform, and orientation. 



### Three Defining Features of Responsive Websites

1. Flexible Layouts: In CSS, we can create the layout of a website with a flexible grid. This method consists of columns that automatically adjust themselves to the size of the screen or browser window.
2. Media Queries: Media queries allow web designers to specify different styles for different screen sizes/devices. Sometimes having flexible layouts isn't enough since the columns may be too small to display content effectively.
3. Flexible images and videos: Flexible containers resize themselves as the user changes the browser or devices. By having a max-width property of 100%, the media content is scalable.
