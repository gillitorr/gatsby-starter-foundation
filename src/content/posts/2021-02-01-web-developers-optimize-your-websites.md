When you hear the word “website optimization,” you may think that it’s too complicated of an idea so you’d rather disregard it. However, website optimization is important because it ensures that people who visit your website will have the best user experience. But what exactly is website optimization anyway?

Website optimization is the process of improving the performance of your website to meet your business objectives. By using tools, advanced strategies, and experiments, your website will be able to further drive more traffic, increase conversion, and grow revenue. The goal of website optimization can vary from business to business: for example, an online store may optimize its website to encourage completion of checkouts and repeat purchases, while an online publication practices website optimization with the conversion goal of increasing the number of articles read.

So how does website optimization work and how can we use it on our own websites?

Website optimization can be thought of as the scientific method. First, you establish a hypothesis by reviewing your analytics: what parts of your website are performing poorly? You want to determine the objective(s) of your website optimization and come up with ideas on how to implement them. Perhaps your online store could improve its checkout page because it takes too long to load. Then, you want to prioritize your list of potential optimizations and test them using A/B testing (A/B testing is a technique used to determine if a specific change made on a webpage will influence conversions in a positive or negative way). Next, you analyze your tests to determine which hypotheses were true. Finally, by implementing the successful tests, you’ll optimize your website for higher conversions with each successful variation. The figure below shows a more visual representation of this process.

There are 8 elements of websites to optimize according to “Website Optimization” by the company Optimizely. These elements include:

1. A headline or key message related to the company’s value proposition
2. The use of visual media (ex: pictures, videos)
3. The length of a form (ex: the number of required fields)
4. The prominent display of customer case studies that describe their success using your product or service
5. The visual style, text, and placement of a call to action (CTA) button or link
6. The organization of the website’s navigation
7. The placement of social sharing functionality
8. The appearance of organization of the webpage for a visitor on a mobile device

These elements are mostly referring to pages such as landing pages, home pages, and checkout processes. By knowing your target audience, you will be able to innovate ways to optimize user experience and build trust with your audience, especially through social proof.

Some other crucial parts of website optimization are search engine optimization (SEO) and loading speed. SEO allows you to generate targeted traffic from interested buyers. In order to optimize your website for search engines, you must figure out what your customers are searching for (keyword research), improve page speed and experience, and get backlinks (websites that share yours). Some page speed and SEO tools the company VWO recommends are the following:

* Pingdom Website Speed Test
* Google Pagespeed Insights
* GT Metrix
* WebPageTest
* Uptrends Speed Test
* Dareboost
* Google Search Console
* Google Ads Keyword Planner
* Screaming Frog SEO Spider

They also have a table that gives an overview of all major optimization areas, which is pictured below.

In short, website optimization allows for visitors of your website to have great user experience without needing a lot of assistance. Rather than being on a support call, being able to make your website have as much information as possible and still be user-friendly allows for a greater experience, higher productivity, and more revenue.
